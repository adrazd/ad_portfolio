Project name: Mental Health in Tech Industry 2014-2019

### Introduction
This project seeks to explore the state of mental health in the tech sector, with a specific focus on gender differences in how these challenges are addressed in the US and Europe. The aim is to understand how men and women in tech experience and report mental health issues differently, and how their respective employers respond to these concerns. By analyzing both the perceptions of mental health and the support systems available to employees, we hope to provide a picture of the mental health needs for men and women in the tech sector.

The project examines whether the existing mental health initiatives in tech companies are adequately addressing mental health related challenges, and how cultural differences between the US and Europe influence these approaches. Ultimately, the findings aim to provide actionable insights into improving workplace mental health strategies in the tech industry, ensuring inclusivity and better support for the affected.

### Conclusions
Considering risks of bias, identified throughout the analysis, it was challenging to draw definitive conclusions from this data. Nevertheless, from the analysis performed on the data, we concluded the following:

**Prevalence Rate**: Observed mental health condition Prevalence Rates are higher in females than those in males. This observation can be attributed to several factors, such as awareness, diagnostical practices, social factors, and biological differences. Confidence interval of 90% is sufficient to account for uncertainties raised.

**Employer's Perception Score**: The overall evaluation score of Employers' Perception of mental health suggests that there is a significant need for employers to enhance their understanding and support of mental health issues affecting employees. The analysis indicates that untreated mental health conditions have a substantial impact on work performance, highlighting the critical need for more effective mental health support and interventions in the workplace.
