Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.",6,6,0,,,Rarely,Often

They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies.
