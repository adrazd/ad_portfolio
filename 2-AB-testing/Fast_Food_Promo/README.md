# Fast Food Marketing Campaign (A/B Testing)
A *Fast-Food Chain* plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still
undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product.
In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new
item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different
promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are
recorded for the first four weeks.

Our goal is to select **key metric** for conducting statistical tests and to identify
the most efficient of the three promotions.

## Additional Task
To create a Looker Studio dashboard, which would show development of sales during the
campaign period. Note: [dashboard created](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/69424494-394f-4fe1-a928-2d29a3a6f17c)
